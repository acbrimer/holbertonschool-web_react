# Task 6

This task does not make sense:

```
Modify the Course actions creators:
• bound the selectCourse action creator
• bound the unSelectCourse action creator

Modify the Notification actions creators:
• bound the markAsAread action creator
• bound the setNotificationFilter action creator

Modify the UI actions creators:
• bound the login action creator
• bound the logout action creator
• bound the displayNotificationDrawer action creator
• bound the hideNotificationDrawer action creator
```

We have not created a store or even installed redux at this point in the project. No idea what the verb `bound` is supposed to mean in this context, since we do not have a dispatch to bind to.
